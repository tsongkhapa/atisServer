ATIS SERVER

Websocket server. Based on chatbot example.

https://blog.bitlabstudio.com/a-simple-chat-app-with-react-node-and-websocket-35d3c9835807 

Very simple. 

Does not support a list of messages. Starts with a single hardcoded message example.

Websocket protocol assumes update only. 

TODO.
Expand to handle a list of messages, and store messages in a DB
Expand web socket protocol to handle create, update, delete
